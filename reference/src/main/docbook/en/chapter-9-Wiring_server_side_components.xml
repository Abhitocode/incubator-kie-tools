    <title>Wiring server side components</title>
    <para>
      By default, ErraiBus uses Google Guice to wire components. However, we plan on standardizing on
      <emphasis role="italics">JSR-330 Dependency Injection</emphasis>
      specification in the near future. When deploying services on the server-side, it is currently possible to obtain references to the
      <code>MessageBus</code>
      ,
      <code>RequestDispatcher</code>
      , the
      <code>ErraiServiceConfigurator</code>
      , and
      <code>ErraiService</code>
      by declaring them as injection dependencies in Service classes, extension components, and session providers.
