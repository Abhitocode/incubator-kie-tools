          <title>Launching maven the first time</title>
          <para>Please note, that when launching maven the first time on your machine, it will fetch all dependencies from a central repository. This may take a while, because it includes downloading large binaries like GWT SDK. However, subsequent builds are not required to go through this step and will be much faster.</para>
