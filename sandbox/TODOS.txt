Genrics & type erasure
************************

 - Inferred castings
    - TransformJSO t = NObjectJSO.make().cast(); -> Produces a classcastexception, as the java stub TransformJSO cannot 
    be casted to the stub NObjectJSO. Java is not as dynamic as the native javascript translated.
     - Replaced use of cast methods for now by providing an stub for Attributes class
    - Finish the missing jso stubs for avoid "cast" in Attributes
