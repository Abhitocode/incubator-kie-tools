About the CDI extension
=======================

This module contains the CDI extension and an installer that allows
you to deploy it as shared service to the JBoss Application Server (requires 6.0.0-M2 or later).


[How to use the installer]

In order to install the service archive you need to modify the 'deployment.properties'
file to reflect your local settings. After that, simply run 'ant', which will copy all
required files (jar files, configuration, etc) to the correct location.


[Creating a CDI project]

Errai ships with a maven archetype that can be used to easily create a
project skeleton that uses GWT, CDI and Errai. Please check the userguide for the
most recent instructions how to do this.
