        <h3><i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>Declarative is Good</h3>
        <p>
        As you move toward a more and more declarative style, you allow the compiler and the framework
        to catch more mistakes up front. Broken links? A thing of the past!
      </div>
      <div class=span4>
        <h3><i class="icon-thumbs-down"></i>Boilerplate is Bad</h3>
        <p>
        The problems you're actually trying to solve are complex enough as it is. Don't make the novel
        code that solves your specific problems into the needle in a haystack of configuration, repetitive
        meaningless drivel, and ornate constructions that work around the framework.
      </div>
      <div class=span4>
        <h3><i class="icon-ok"></i>Code it Once</h3>
        <p>
        When it comes to solving a business problem in code, once is <em>more than</em> enough! As compelling
        as the autonomous AJAX based client architecture is, when your client code is in JavaScript and your
        server code isn't, you're now committed maintaining two apps in parallel, and keeping them up-to-date
        in lock step.
